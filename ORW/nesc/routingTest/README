To use the routing test, you must first apply some patches to ctp.
HOWTO

1) Copy the entire content of $RUOTINGTESTROOT/common/ctp_patches/* 
into $TOSROOT/tos/lb/net

2) Run the applyPatches script

3) Remove the applyPatches script

The patches should maintain backward compatibility by using the CTP_CLEAR
macro.
