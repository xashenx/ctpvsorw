1. First, you should patch CTP. Refer to "nesc/routingTests/README"
for details.

2. Edit "PLR/PLR.h"
2.i. Setup NR_NODES to be equal to the number of nodes in the network.
2.ii. Be sure that PAYLOAD_LENGTH is equal to the MSG_SIZE defined in the
Makefile.

3. Please notice that the sink must have AM_ID = 0, and the rest of
the nodes ID from 1 to NR_NODES.

4. Compile and flash the motes. First go to the "nesc" dir.
4.i. To compile and flash the sink mote, execute "./make.sink bsl,/
ttyUSB#". Replace # with your USB2serial minor. When prompted, plug
the mote into the USB port of you machine.
4.ii. To compile and flash the network nodes, execute "./make.net
NR_NODES bsl,/ttyUSB#". Replace NR_NODES with the actual value and #
with your USB2serial minor. Plug each mote in the USB port in turns
when prompted to.
4.iii. Support for bridge node is not available yet for the routing
part. Hold on...

5. Edit "java/src/netTest/strings.properties" to set up the port where you
connected the mote to. (If you use the *.class files of the java application
instead of the jar file you can change the properties after the building
process in "java/bin/netTest/strings.properties").

6. Go to the "java" dir. Type "ant" to build the java application. If
the build fails, type "ant" again. It should work now.

7. Start running experiments.

7.i. The syntax to run Luca's stuff is:

java -cp "$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar:netTests.jar"
netTest.LaunchTest [ PURE_PLR | MAC_PLR | LPL_PLR ] [experiment id]
[number of packets] [test channel] [delta time] {LPL check interval}

PLEASE MAKE SURE that you increase the experiment id for each test you
run. Use milliseconds when expressing time.

7.ii. To run the routing stuff...

java -cp "$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar:netTests.jar"
netTest.LaunchTest ROUTING [experiment id] [app period] [run period] [power]
{DESYNCH_APP}

By default, the runtime output is produced in "java/logs/global.txt".
Experiment id must have an increasing value. All messages are dumped into 
"java/logs/msg-EXPERIMENT_ID-TIMESTAMP.bin". Use seconds when expressing time.

The runtime statistics are somehow inaccurate (as they cannot provide
some stats). After you finish the experiment, please run

java -cp "$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar:netTests.jar"
netTest.HistoryProcessor MESSAGE_DUMP_FILE

The output is appended to "java/logs/results.txt".
