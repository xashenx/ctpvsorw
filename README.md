The base application is taken from the one developed for the work made by the D3S group of Trento described in the paper "How Environmental Factors Impact Outdoor Sensor Networks: A Case of Study". The application has been modified to fit the need of the work of my MC thesis, aiming to analyse the impact of environmental factors (temperature and humidity) on the performance of the routing layer. In particular, the performances of two routing protocols were compared: CTP, namely Collection Tree Protocol, the de-facto standard routing protocol used in WSNs and ORW, Opportunistic Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks, a newly proposed opportunistic routing protocol.
